# Donkey Kong OOP Project

This is my first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project in C++.

The project demonstrates core OOP principles including:
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**

It also features:
- **Game recording and replay** functionality.

Developed as part of an academic assignment to practice design and implementation of class-based architecture in C++.
